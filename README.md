# Studying
### This is a space where I'll list the study materials I used on certifications. 
### The best overall advice I have is to do some framing before each exam. For example, CySA+ will ask you to think like a cybersecurity analyst. Something like CISSP will ask you to think like an ISSM or similar manager, so the approach for each question will be completely different. Consider who a certification is for, and respond to questions from that job title's point of view.
## CySA+

## CCNA
### <a href= https://www.certskills.com/> Labs </a>
A handy website with hundreds of labs and Q&A-style threads. Completing labs on sections you struggle with will be the fastest way to fill those learning gaps. Use packet tracer for the best experience.

### <a href= https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccna-200-301-official-cert-guide-library-9781587147142> Books </a>
If you are more of a book learner (as I am), I would recommend Wendell Odom’s official cert guides on CCNA. They're not 100% necessary to pass it, but are useful for future reference even outside the exam. Check Amazon and other websites to get the best price.

### <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZpopqhKk8&list=PLhfrWIlLOoKPc2RecyiM_A9nf3fUU3e6g"> Videos </a>
David Bombal is the best source for video courses on Cisco exams that I have found. He also has a more comprehensive course on Udemy, but this free one on YouTube should be enough. I recommend taking handwritten notes as you watch to lock in the material.

### <a href= https://subnettingpractice.com/> Subnetting </a>
You will need to know subnetting on the exam. They are needed for both multiple choice and PBQ portions of the test. Once you can solve any subnetting problem within 30 seconds or so, you are ready.

### <a href= https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/200-301-cisco-ccna-practice-exam> Practice Tests </a>
I didn’t personally use it, but I have heard great things about Boson for labs and practice exams. You’d need to pay for this one.
