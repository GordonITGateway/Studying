# Studying
### This is a space where I'll list the study materials I used on certifications. 
### The best overall advice I have is to do some framing before each exam. For example, CySA+ will ask you to think like a cybersecurity analyst. Something like CISSP will ask you to think like an ISSM or similar manager, so the approach for each question will be completely different. Consider who a certification is for, and respond to questions from that job title's point of view.

## General
### <a href= https://apps.ankiweb.net/> Memorization </a>
The Anki deck system of periodic review is invaluable for locking in acronyms and concepts that require memorization. It is originally intended for learning languages, but you can find decks online for a wide variety of tech certifications.

## CISSP

### <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/user/thorpedersen/"> Videos </a>
Thor Pedersen's video courses on Udemy cover all domains and include quizzes/tests as you go to solidify the material.

### <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/learning/isc2-certified-information-systems-security-professional-cissp-2024-cert-prep"> More Videos </a>
Mike Chapple's videos on LinkedIn Learning are a good overview and he explains complex topics such as security models in a simple-to-understand way. They pair well with his books below.

### <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Certified-Information-Security-Professional-Official-ebook/dp/B0D57LP9BT?crid=2FDWIF10K4FAF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.HhM9gXw0LgbQJqDFVBq9tA6Zrpek1gtwca92zWe6J96jhGmwUnMipx6d5h5y_jB_2NDn7joA2FqUnC36wtIJbHL1oAaRsE4ws3-_dZXLS9m_i3_lgObt_pcr-H8YwIlnuRMZdkte4bK8BXSuF6cQRYOwXmhfRgGLcc64Rh8LYM_ZmNKbnuFIHnHaLv6QgfM5slfycY-XugbXh1LJwIb7aPUrprXIQeZvJGsDpmi13YM.T2t7drmz_q-W87REp_vYn8mqHJn55gUrl0cP_EEy8LM&dib_tag=se&keywords=isc2+cissp&qid=1734881659&s=digital-text&sprefix=isc2+cissp%2Cdigital-text%2C292&sr=1-1"> Books </a>
The official ISC2 Sybex books were my main resource for CISSP. By giving myself a page goal per day I managed to read through it twice, highlighting important passages first and then reading those for the second time. Some domains, such as 3 and 4, will require additional attention and Googling because of the complexity of the topics.

### YouTube Videos (mostly domain 3):

### <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZKdGEfEyJhLd-pJhAD7dNbJyUgpqI4pu"> MindMaps </a>
For the final review in the last 2 weeks or so, I used Destination Certification's CISSP MindMap series. It breaks each domain into a set of videos, noting key concepts and acronyms that are relevant to that domain.

## CySA+
### <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMYSjEaGLw_vGxGsAIUgmkbEm52QR02tx"> Videos </a>
CertifyBreakfast's CySA+ series is excellent, and not just for achieving the certification. He covers all exam topics and goes extra in-depth on some of them, allowing you to get a deeper understanding. I recommend taking notes as you watch; I scanned the 100 pages or so of notes that I took and linked them here for reference:
[Gordon_Notes_CySA+.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17528745/Gordon_Notes_CySA%2B_compressed.pdf)

### <a href= https://www.amazon.com/CompTIA-CySA-Study-Guide-CS0-003/dp/1394182902> Books </a>
Mike Chapple's official Sybex books are a solid resource, and the included labs are also great. I didn't read the entire thing, as I felt the video series above adequately covered the concepts, but the labs were good for reinforcing more technical portions of the exam.

### <a href= https://lognpacific.com/free-certification-practice-tests/free-comptia-cysa-practice-tests/> Practice Questions </a>
Josh Makador has compiled a great set of test questions that match the domains of the Sybex books. They can be used on this website or downloaded offline as an Anki deck if you enter your email. 

## CCNA
### <a href= https://www.certskills.com/> Labs </a>
A handy website with hundreds of labs and Q&A-style threads. Completing labs on sections you struggle with will be the fastest way to fill those learning gaps. Use packet tracer for the best experience.

### <a href= https://www.ciscopress.com/store/ccna-200-301-official-cert-guide-library-9781587147142> Books </a>
If you are more of a book learner (as I am), I would recommend Wendell Odom’s official cert guides on CCNA. They're also useful for future reference even outside the exam. Check Amazon and other websites to get the best price.

### <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxZpopqhKk8&list=PLhfrWIlLOoKPc2RecyiM_A9nf3fUU3e6g"> Free Videos </a> 
David Bombal is the best source for complete video courses on Cisco exams I've found. This free YouTube playlist should be enough when combined with books or other resources. I recommend taking handwritten notes as you watch to lock in the material.

### <a href= "https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-networking-fundamentals-course-ccna-start/?couponCode=LEARNNOWPLANS"> Paid Videos </a>
If you can get Udemy courses for free, either through your company or the military, I've also linked David Bombal's paid course.

### <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSodBEAJz9Y&list=PLF1hDMPPRqGxpYdo0ctaa7MxfOi9vjs1u"> Additional Videos </a>
CertBros has a great series of animated YouTube videos covering individual concepts such as STP or NAT. Use these as a refresher or before doing labs on the subject.

### <a href= https://subnettingpractice.com/> Subnetting </a>
You will need to know subnetting on the exam. They are needed for both multiple choice and PBQ portions of the test. Once you can solve any subnetting problem within 30 seconds or so, you are ready.

### <a href= https://www.boson.com/practice-exam/200-301-cisco-ccna-practice-exam> Practice Tests </a>
I didn’t personally use it, but I have heard great things about Boson for labs and practice exams. You’d need to pay for this one.
